I wanted to see if from this data it could be determined which education choices were the best and which were the worst for earning potential. I evaluated by starting salary and percent increase at mid-career. I thought that to get a full picture, it was important to look at highest and lowest.

I also thought that as a reader, I would want to see this information, even if it was a little beyond the main focus of the article. 

Working in Excel, I duplicated each data set and renamed it WKG before original name so that in case I inadvertently changed the data, I would have the original downloads.

For each worksheet, to make sorting clearer:
* I deleted to top row and froze the top and side panes.
* I wrapped the text and expanded the row depth so I could read each column header easily.
* I added a “Percent change from Starting to Mid-Career Salary” calculation to the School Type and Region sheets. I put in the formula *New number – original number/original number* or *=(D2-C2)/C2* for the first line.

Next
* Then double-clicked left corner to autofill to bottom.
* I formatted the column to show numbers as percentages.
* I did a copy and paste special as values onto that column to have the actual number in the cell instead of the formula. This is to make pivot tables easier to deal with.
