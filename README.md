# J124 Final Project - Salaries After Graduation
## Where does it pay off to focus your college efforts:
### Major/Degree
### School Type
### Region

I wanted to see if from this data it could be determined which education choices were the best and which were the worst for earning potential. 

One data set is humorous - describing a type of school as "party". Since I included this data set, I thought my article pitch should be on the more levitous side.

Also, I question how useful is this data beyond interest/amusement? Most kids will go to local schools for affordability. How many have access to ivy league education? 

**The most valuable information from these data sets is *Degree*. That is what one can actually choose.** 

What would be further explored in my article -- beyond this data set -- is how region dependent are salaries? 

I evaluated by *starting salary* and *percent increase at mid-career*. 

I thought that to get a full picture, it was important to look at highest and lowest. I also thought that as a reader, I would want to see this information, no matter the focus of the article. 

Working in Excel:
* I duplicated each data set and renamed it WKG before original name so that in case I inadvertently changed the data, I would have the original downloads.
* For each worksheet, to make sorting clearer, I deleted to top row and froze the top and side panes.
* I wrapped the text and expanded the row depth so I could read each column header easily.
* I added a “Percent change from Starting to Mid-Career Salary” calculation to the School Type and Region sheets. I put in the formula
* *New number – original number/original number* or *=(D2-C2)/C2* for the first line.
* Then double-clicked left corner to autofill to bottom.
* I formatted the column to show numbers as percentages.

Next, to make pivot tables easier to deal with 
* I did a copy and paste special as values onto that column to have the actual number in the cell instead of the formula.
